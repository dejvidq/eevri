## Eevri - read it later app

Eevri, as you probably already have guessed, comes from "I will read it". At the beginning I wanted to call it "IWRI", but I just think "Eevri" is better. It's also how you'll read "IWRI" phonetically in Polish.

It's fun project. I've no idea if I will ever make it working. But even if, you probably shouldn't use it, and the alternatives are much better and have more features.

The only thing, where Eevri will be different than alternatives like Pocket, Instapaper or Raindrop is that'll be self-hosted. No main server, no random users on the same instance. Just you, and the people you invited.

You own the data.
